              Working at a start-up since day one generally means you end up
              taking on a lot of responsibilities outside of your job
              description and title. As one of the first employees at the
              company, not only was I responsible for design tasks, but as the
              only front-end developer in the company meant that I was also

              When I moved to Los Angeles from New York, ironically I ended up
              working for a newly-started digital marketing agency based in New
              York. For two years, I worked remotely from home until we expanded
              the company to officially have an office in Los Angeles. That
              being said, today, 95% of the work I do is still done remotely as
              our clients are based all over the country.

              In today's world, you could pay $5, $1000, or more than $10,000
              for something as small as a logo and still end up with something
              that looks good. So why are the costs so vastly different and why
              does it matter? The difference in price is very much the
              difference between poor design and great design.

              The Internet has gotten a lot more complicated since I started
              building websites when I was 13 years old in my parents' house.
              There a lot more browsers, devices, frameworks and platforms.
              Front-end, back-end, React, Ruby, Python, UX/UI - it gets
              jargon-heavy real fast. So what and who do you need to get
              yourself a website?
